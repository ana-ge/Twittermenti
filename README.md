This is an app that takes data from Twitter using Twitter API. It shows us how people react to certain companies or hashtags using emojis. So, this app takes a certain amount of tweets about this company, or hashtag and predicts and analyzes which tweets are good/bad/neutral by using Machine Learning. In this app we are implementing CoreML, SwifteriOS and SwiftyJSON.
